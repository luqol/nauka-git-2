            There once was a ship that put to sea <br>
            The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea <br>
            The winds blew up, her bow dipped down <br>
            O blow, my bully boys, blow (Huh!) 
        </p>
        <p>
            Soon may the Wellerman come <br>
            To bring us sugar and tea and rum <br> 
            One day, when the tonguin' is done  <br>
            We'll take our leave and go 
        </p>
        <p>
            She had not been two weeks from shore <br>
            When down on her a right whale bore <br>
            The captain called all hands and swore <br>
            He'd take that whale in tow (Huh!)
        </p>
        <p>
            Soon may the Wellerman come <br>
            To bring us sugar and tea and rum <br> 
            One day, when the tonguin' is done  <br>
            We'll take our leave and go 
        </p>
        <p>
            Da-ra, ra-ra-ra-ta, ra-ra-ra-ta, ra-ra-ra-ra-ta <br>
            Da-ra, ra-ra-ra-ta, ra-ra-ra-ta-ra-da
        </p>
        <p>
            Soon may the Wellerman come <br>
            To bring us sugar and tea and rum <br> 
            One day, when the tonguin' is done  <br>
            We'll take our leave and go
